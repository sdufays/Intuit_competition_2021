            <p>Everyone knows how it feels to be excluded––to be perpetually labeled as something “other” or even inferior. When your contributions to a team seem to fall short and your efforts seem to mean nothing, it’s almost certainly because of unconscious biases. We each face these biases in varying degrees, but for marginalized groups, these biases steal their opportunities and oppress their voices. So, we’ve provided some tips on how you can help decrease these biases in your community.</p>

          <p>Most privileged people don’t acknowledge and admit their own advantages, but have no problem addressing that other people are. Privileged people are taught to think of their lives as morally neutral, normative, and average, and are never exposed to the concept that they are unfairly advantaged or oppressors.</p>

          <br>
          <p>Pronouns are words that are used in place of a proper noun (usually a name), and they are specific to gender. For example, in the sentence “John is taking a nap,” we can replace John’s name with the pronoun “he,” so: ”He is taking a nap.”</p>
          <br>
          <p>He and she are the most common pronouns in English, but they may not fit for queer, gender non-conforming, non-binary, and transgender people. This often causes stress and anxiety for them, but research shows that using the proper pronouns helps alleviate some of that struggle. Using peoples’ proper pronouns is absolutely crucial in supporting true acceptance and inclusion––it is a basic show of respect for their identity.</p>
          <br>
          <p>In this article, you’ll learn about the difference between sex and gender, the different genders there are, and why it’s so important to use correct pronouns.</p>

          <p>In times like these, it’s easy to get swept up in the idea of inclusivity––in the world of instagram infographics proclaiming bare-minimum actions like “Don’t touch people without their consent! Don’t say racist slurs! Repost to become anti-discrimination!”, the meaning of being an ally can get lost in the cursive lettering and flower decals.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Although infographics never hurt anyone, it’s important to follow up your social media posts/reposts with genuine self-reflection and community action. Even in diverse spaces, marginalized people’s voices are often drowned out, so being an ally means promoting truly diverse environments where everyone’s opinions are valued. It’s important to remember that allies use their privilege and credibility to create inclusivity––not just talk about it.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This article provides concrete tips for you to be an ally both in the workplace and in your everyday life, from vocally supporting the work of colleagues from underrepresented groups in situations that will help boost their standing and reputations, to advocating for them to serve public roles, bringing attention to their ideas and opinions, and much more!</p>

          <p>It may be surprising to learn, but the language we use in our day to day lives is filled with words that just a few years ago, were used to discriminate and tear down people with differing ideals and origins. Words that are seemingly innocuous, such as “hooligan” or “insane”, are deeply rooted in discriminatory practices that were commonly used in harmful scenarios.</p>
          <br>
          <p>It’s important to make sure that the words we use give off the correct denotation and connotation that we intend, as using words ingrained in hatred can not only create discomfort in any conversation, but it can also resurface years of psychological trauma that was experienced by many groups.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Language is used constantly in our environment, so it’s our job to make sure that the language we use is as accepting as possible!</p>

          <br>
          <p>The terms “stereotypes” and “discrimination” are often used interchangeably in everyday conversation, but few people pause to reflect on the differences and overlap between them.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Stereotypes are oversimplified generalizations about groups of people and can be based on race, ethnicity, age, gender, sexual orientation—almost any characteristic. They are often negative and usually targeted toward other groups, such as when members of a dominant racial group suggest that a subordinate racial group is less intelligent or lazy. The main issue with stereotyping is that it is a generalization that doesn’t take individual differences into account.</p>
          <br>
          <p>New stereotypes are rarely created; instead, they are recycled from subordinate groups that have assimilated into society and are reused to describe newly subordinate groups. For example, many stereotypes that are currently used to characterize black people were used earlier in American history to characterize Irish and Eastern European immigrants.</p>
