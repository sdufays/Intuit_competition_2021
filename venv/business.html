            <p><B>Diversity Sells.</B></p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>The more diverse a community, the more creative it becomes. Whether it is through improving the bottom line of companies or leading to breakthrough innovations, diversity encourages the search for novel information and perspectives, leading to better decision making and problem solving. Even simply being exposed to diversity can change the way you think because people with different backgrounds bring new information, so interacting with different people forces group members to prepare better, to anticipate alternative viewpoints, and to expect that reaching consensus will take effort.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This creativity pays off. Companies with diverse teams have a 20% higher rate of innovation and 19% higher innovation revenues, are 35% more likely to have returns above national industry medians, and 2.3 times the cash flow per employee.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In fact, beyond the obvious moral and ethical consequences, failing to elevate DEI—or enabling outright discrimination––will actually cause active harm to companies. The Center for American Progress estimates that workplace discrimination costs businesses $64 billion annually.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Aside from the innovation it brings, DEI also helps every employee show up each day without fear of being their true selves. This fosters higher degrees of engagement, productivity, and innovation that contribute to increased revenue.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Therefore, we’ve provided some toolkits, programs, and methods below that All-Inclusive recommends to incorporate within your business or organization to encourage innovation, increase customer satisfaction, and ensure that all employees and members are comfortable and heard.</p>

          <p>When getting into the process of starting and maintaining a business, it can be difficult to make sure you're diversifying not only your product, but also the team behind it all. Making sure your employees are diverse is important, as it benefits the fight against discrimination and can bring your business the new perspectives, beliefs, and ideas that you need to bring growth to your work.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Many businesses are striving to increase their multiculturalism, but there isn’t a solid way to keep track of your goals and track exactly what areas you have filled with diversity and which areas are lacking. Fortunately, we’ve done all the hard work and compiled resources and ways to document your journey towards reaching your goals of diversity, equity, and inclusion. This can be used to examine multiple places, such as the pay levels of your staff, the composition of your employees, and makes it easy to see the different ways you can improve your staff and work towards the best configuration.

          <p>Especially with the unemployment that came with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is absolutely imperative that we do our best to ensure equal job opportunities for everyone. However, that’s easier said than done when implicit and unconscious biases are already so deeply ingrained into our minds. Fortunately, our Hiring Toolkit was created to mitigate implicit biases in the hiring process, making it almost impossible to discriminate by creating objective methods to evaluate candidates. We emphasize the value of covering names to prevent name bias, and objective reviews to prevent the Halo/Horns Effect, as well as many other tips to create equity for your organization in this article!</p>

          <p>Microaggressions and discriminatory “jokes” are, unfortunately, prevalent everywhere in the world. Often, people being discriminated against feel helpless and alone. To alleviate this struggle as much as possible, we have a “We Hear You” Toolkit that allows people to (anonymously or not anonymously) report harassment or to suggest ways to improve the community. By implementing this system, people who have been discriminated against can be connected to other people with the same experience or speak to someone who may be able to help.</p>
          <br>
          <p>We want to promote equity as much as possible, and we know how difficult it is to succeed when people are repeatedly shut down, insulted, and discriminated against, so this toolkit is made to accurately fit everyone’s needs. However, it is important to adjust and build upon the practices we suggest based on whichever organization it is being applied to. Read more about this toolkit and how to use it in this article!</p>

          <br>
          <p>Humans are visual creatures. We rely heavily on visual cues for basic adaptive behaviors, as well as more complex behaviors such as parental care and the formation of social hierarchies. So, when we search up an image of a doctor, entrepreneur, lawyer, or any other highly paying job, and all we see are cis white men, it creates a unconscious bias that tells us “Success is for cis white men; it’s not for me, and it’s not for people like me.”</p>
          <br>
          <p>When you think of a happy couple, what do you see? What about an excelling student, or a hardworking employee? When you picture a workplace, what do you see? People often picture white people as the default, and this is a very subtle unconscious bias that can be counteracted by greater exposure to images and media containing diversity. Seeing people from all different backgrounds working together opens people’s minds up to what is normal––because a conference room filled with only white men should not be the default. Diversity allows so many new perspectives to be expressed, and we should not accept or even settle for a lack of it. This article goes into depth about how we can use images to counteract unconscious bias and promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in all spaces (even online).</p>
